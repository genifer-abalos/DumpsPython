When something is synchronously,
    actually it's not doing much on the CPU

CPU bound tasks
    - crunching a lot of numbers

IO bound tasks
    - waitng for input and output
    i.e. reading/writing from the file system, networking, downloading stuff online


We benefit using threading for IO bound tasks

For CPU bound tasks, we might be better off using multithreading
