for CPU bound tasks

runs in parallels


Use case,
    image processing instead of image downloading

    image processing uses CPU
    image downloading uses IO


Note:
In using concurrent.futures module,
    you can easily SWITCH this to ThreadPoolExecutor

    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(process_image, image_names)

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future_results = executor.map(download_image, image_urls)
